# sha256-rs
A rust implementation of the NSA's SHA256 Protocol with research and math documents

The purpose of this project was to do a deeper dive into understanding the works of SHA256 and also to start to learn proper Rust syntax. The library created can input text or bytes and output a proper SHA256 hash. A build test is also included to ensure changes did not break the algorithm.
